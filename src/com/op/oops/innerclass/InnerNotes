The main danger with inner classes is that they have access to the parent’s private fields, 
which can lead to unexpected side-effects. 

(non-static) inner classes can manipulate private state and that’s dangerous

So I think non-static inner classes should always be private or anonymous, 
Problem is that then inner class can’t then be tested directly.
