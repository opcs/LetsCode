 Now we have a template for creating immutable objects.
    Make all fields private
    Don't provide mutators
    Ensure that methods can't be overridden by either making the class final (Strong Immutability) or 
	making your methods final (Weak Immutability)
    If a field isn't primitive or immutable, make a deep clone on the way in (setters) and the way out (getters).
